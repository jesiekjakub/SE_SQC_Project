# SE_SQC_Project
College SE Project: For analysts documenting functional requirements with scenarios, our SQC app will provide quantitative information and enable detection of problems in functional requirements written in the form of scenarios. The app will be available via GUI and also as a remote API, thanks to which it can be integrated with existing tools.
